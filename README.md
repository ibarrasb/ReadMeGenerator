## Description
üîç The purpose of this project is to make it a lot easier to spend time making a README file, rather than having to spend a lot more time trying to create one, and the user can spend more of their time doing things more valueable like aactually coding. It'll also help ( people such as myself) to actually want to make a readme, because all good projects contain them
